collectd_py_plugins
===================

If you are looking for some original work, go somewhere else.  
These two python scripts are blatantly based on:  
RabbitMQ plugin at https://github.com/marksteele/collectd-plugins  
redis-collectd-plugin https://github.com/powdahound/redis-collectd-plugin  
ss_get_mysql_stats.py at https://github.com/palominodb/mysql-stats-to-graphite
